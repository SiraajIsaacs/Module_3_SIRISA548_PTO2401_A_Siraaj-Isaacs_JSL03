# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

# Instructions

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Repo Link: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL03

1. Access the provided repository containing the starter code and presentation template.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.

## Step 2: Analyze the Examples

1. In the cloned repository, you will find two JavaScript code examples labeled "Example 1" and "Example 2."
2. Examine each code example and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

## Step 3: Record Your Presentation

1. Use Loom (https://www.loom.com/).
2. Create a single video presentation for both examples that include the following:

   - Introduction of the example number.
   - Explanation of whether the example is imperative or declarative.
   - Detailed reasoning for your choice, discussing the code logic and style used in the example.
   - Mention any specific code structures or patterns that align with the chosen programming paradigm.
   
3. Keep each video presentation concise, with a maximum length of 2 minutes for each example. Your total recording time should not exceed 5 minutes.

## Step 4: Insert Loom Links

1. After recording, upload your presentation videos to Loom.
2. Obtain the Loom recording links for the video presentation.
3. Edit the `README.md` file in the cloned repository and insert the Loom recording links.
   
## Step 5: Submit Your Project
1. Commit your changes to the Git repository and push them to your GitHub account.
2. Ensure that the repository is public so that it can be accessed.
3. Submit the GitHub project link (URL) that includes your Loom recording link to the [JSL03] Project Tab on the LMS for evaluation.

# Project Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on your ability to:

- Accurately identify and differentiate between imperative and declarative programming styles.
- Provide clear and well-reasoned explanations for your choices.
- Present your findings concisely within the specified time limit.
- Follow the submission instructions accurately.

Follow the steps outlined above to complete the project successfully.

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: 1

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 
   - Start by explaining the code logic in the imperative approach.
      - Step by step process clearly defining what each step does on how to cook the steak.
      - Follows a sequence and has a flow into each step after going through it start to finish.
   - Mention each step of the process in the code.
      - Discussed each step in the video explaining the purpose of it.
   - Describe how the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
      - Provided in video where it is telling the computer what to do and how to do it.
   - Discuss the use of variables to track the state and progress of the process.
      - Use of let variables where the variables are being manipulated making them mutable.

2. **Emphasis on How:** 
   - Highlight how the imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished.
      - Discussed in video with the use of steps on how to cook the steak.
   - Point out the use of loops, conditions, and explicit instructions.
      - While loops and if statements used and discussed.
   - Discuss any mutable variables or states that change during execution.
      - State changes mentioned with the use of let variables and variable assignment. 


Example #: 2

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** 
   - Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
      - Code logic explained with the use of statements and loops on what the outcome should be.
   - Describe the cooking process in a high-level, abstract manner.
      - Cooking process discussed. 
   - Emphasize that the code defines "what" should happen rather than "how" it should happen.
      - Emphasis explained on what should happen rather than the process.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** 
   - Discuss the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.
      - Arrays and objects discussed to represent the steps.
   - Explain how the process steps are organized in a structured format.
      - Structured format by executing each block of code.
   - Mention any abstraction layers or functions used to encapsulate actions.
      - Encapsulation explained in the switch case statements.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
- Reflect on what you've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.
   - I've learned that there are more ways to code than just imperative by stating exactly what to do and that each coding paradigm has its own control flow and structure.
   - Each programming paradigm has a similar or same end result, however the process on getting these results differ but lets us reach the same goal.
